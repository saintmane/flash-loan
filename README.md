How to Use
Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root and fill in the necessary environment variables.
Install Dependencies:

Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required Python packages.
Run the Bot:

Execute the script with python flash_loan_bot.py.
Additional Considerations
Security:

Ensure private keys and other sensitive information are handled securely.
Use a secure method for storing and accessing the .env file.
Testing:

Thoroughly test the bot on a testnet before deploying it on the mainnet to ensure its stability and correctness.
Performance:

Optimize the bot to handle the large volume of transactions efficiently.
Implement additional performance monitoring and optimization as needed.
Logging and Monitoring:

Consider setting up more advanced logging and monitoring solutions to track the bot's performance and debug issues in production.
By following these steps, you will have a more robust and production-ready arbitrage bot capable of detecting and executing profitable flash loan arbitrages in the Ethereum network.
